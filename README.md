# 📡 Radar Target Classification using ANN

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying radar targets (such as aircraft types or signal sources) using **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**. By analyzing Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Radar Cross Section (RCS) data, the model demonstrates how Deep Learning can be applied in **Defense Technologies** and **Signal Processing**.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- **`Signal_Processing_and_Classification.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and performance visualization.
- **Dataset**: Synthetic radar signal data used for training the model.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / Keras
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Key Results
- Successfully implemented noise reduction techniques on raw signals.
- Achieved high classification accuracy on the test set.
- Visualized loss and accuracy metrics to monitor model performance.

## 🎯 Future Work
- Integrating Real-time signal processing.
- Implementing CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for spectrogram analysis.
